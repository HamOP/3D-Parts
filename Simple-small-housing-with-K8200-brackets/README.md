Description
--------
This is a small housing - inside dimensions 40x60x28mm which I made for my K8200 to keep the PCB for external headed power. It can be attached to the printer frame.  <br />
<br />
The "Boden V4" is changed to be able to print it upright so that the profile clamp will be stronger as I broke the first one I printed because the layers delaminated when I tried to bend it.

Instructions

None
