Description
--------
With this clamp, you can attach your GoPro camera to the strap of your backpack, your jacket, belt or any other thin, flat object with a thickness of about 2-3 mm or about 5 mm for the "thicker" version.

Instructions
--------
Can be printed without support if you stand it on the side where the GoPro adapter is. The nut feature needed some simple cleaning for me, but that was no problem.
