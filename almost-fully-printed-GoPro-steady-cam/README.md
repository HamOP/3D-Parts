Description
--------
This steady cam only needs a few non-printed parts, the rest can be printed. Z rotation is enabled by a 608 ball bearing, while the other two axes are just running on M4 screws.   <br />
<br />
The design works great - of course, a "pendulum type" steady cam like this one has some drawbacks, but it's still good enough for some really nice action footage!  <br />
<br />
After designing this, I found one here which is also very simple and cheap and additionally has a very nice design: <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:84142" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">thingiverse.com/thing:84142</a>. Maybe I should have searched first ;-)  <br />
I really liked MaximFilm's idea of the handles for the threaded rod, so I decided to adopt it and also add one above and below the gimbal.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, this one is even cheaper. I paid 1 Euro for a 1m M8 rod and about 3 Euros for almost a kilogram of nuts and washers at our local hardware discounter. The most expensive part is the bearing - if you have to buy it. I took mine from an old pair of rollerblades. So, together with approx. 20 meters of PLA, total cost is much less than 10 Euros.  <br />
<br />
UPDATE: Parts were re-uploaded in the orientation I printed them.

Instructions
--------
You will need the STLs printed (all of them should print without support besides the GoPro mount) plus:  <br />
<br />
- one 608 ball bearing  <br />
- 9 M8 nuts  <br />
- some M8 washers  <br />
- an M8 threaded rod, length still tbd - I think it will be around 40 cm  <br />
- an M8x100mm screw for the handle  <br />
- four M4 x 20 mm screws (you will have to trim them)  <br />
- four M4 self-locking nuts  <br />
- four M4 washers  <br />
- some big washers as a weight (I used 10 with a 13 mm bore, so I used the "Weight tube" printed part to center them)
