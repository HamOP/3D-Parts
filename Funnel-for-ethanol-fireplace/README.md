Description
--------
In our town, a big hardware store is closing and so I got an ethanol fireplace from there for a really great price. It's a nice addition to our living room and makes it even more cosy. The only thing that annoys me is filling up the ethanol tank as it only has a rather small opening which makes it very hard not to spill the fluid all over the place.  <br />
<br />
So, I fired up the 3D printer and made a simple funnel which exactly fits onto the burner slit and makes filling up a breeze. As the burner is not completely flat, I cut out the bottom to make it stand stable.  <br />
<br />
Let's see how long the PLA will withstand the ethanol of if it will degrade over time.

Instructions
--------
Printed in PLA, 0.3 mm layer, 20% infill.
