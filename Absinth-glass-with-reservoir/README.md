Description
--------
After making Big-E's Balancier (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:123557), I thought that I needed a stylish absinth glass to go with it. As it's Sunday today and I cannot buy one, I'm currently printing one ;-)  <br />
<br />
It has a reservoir in the bottom which will hold 4 cl of absinth and should be big enough (if my calculations were right) to allow an up to 1:5 thinning of it.
