Description
--------
My son just got a Vapor gun which shoots out small gel balls. As the opening for refilling it is rather small, he asked me for a funnel for it.

Instructions
--------
For some reason, Cura tried to print one solid layer in the middle of the part. If that also happens to you, please let me know and I will check the STL again.
