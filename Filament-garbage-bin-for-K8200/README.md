Description
--------
I liked the idea of FOmenal's recup box, so i designed one for my K8200. Thanks for the inspiration!  <br />
<br />
The holder fits onto the extruded aluminium profile of the printer and is fixed with two M5x10 bolts.  <br />
<br />
Update: Added a second holder for the bin which has two notches to keep the bin in place a little better. As you now will have to slide in the bin from the top, I also opened the clearance between the holder and the bin a little bit. It fits perfectly!

Instructions
--------
Print holder upside down so you will need no support.  <br />
<br />
The bin can simply be printed as it is. As the walls are very thin and the part is quite large, a brim is recommended to increase adhesion to the heat bed.
