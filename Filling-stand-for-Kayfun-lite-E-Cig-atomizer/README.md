Description
--------
The Kayfun and Kayfun lite E-cigarette atomizers are filled with E-liquid from the bottom through a small screw hole. I created this small stand to be able to position the atomizer upside-down without the need of disassembling the mouth piece or needing a third hand for the refill.  <br />
<br />
Version 2 includes a tray feature for keeping the small screw that normally closes the filling hole while it is removed.  <br />
<br />
Inventor files can be posted if needed.

Instructions
--------
Should be a quite easy print - no support needed. Print at about 25% infill and 3-4 solid top layers.
