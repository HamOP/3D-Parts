Description
--------
My K8200 is controlled by a Raspberry Pi running OctoPi, so for setting up a print, I normally use my iPad Air to control it for changing filament and so on. As I don't have a place to securely put it on the closet where the printer is standing, I already almost dropped it.  <br />
<br />
So, as a solution, I made this dock which clips to the top frame of the K8200 and can hold my iPad Air (with Smart Case) while working on the printer.

Instructions
