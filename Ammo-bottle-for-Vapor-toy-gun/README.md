Description
--------
My son just got a new Vapor toy gun which shoots small gel balls. In the set, they come in a plastic bag which is not very nice to handle.  <br />
<br />
As I had some small plastic bottles lying around, I made an ammo bottle for him so he can fill the gun directly from this. I think it's rather cool as it looks a little like a gun powder bottle for an old muzzle loader ;-)

Instructions
--------
Everything prints nicely without support. There are some bridges in the lid, but Slic3r and my printer managed them without any problem.
